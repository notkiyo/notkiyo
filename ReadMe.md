# 💫 About Me
**Fun Fact:** Did you know that the AK-47 has been transformed into a guitar, known as the **Escopetarra**? Colombian musician and peace activist **César López** created this unique instrument in 2006. One sold for **$17,000** at a fundraiser for victims of anti-personnel mines, and another was exhibited at the **United Nations’ Conference on Disarmament**. This creative transformation showcases the versatility and iconic status of the AK-47 beyond its military context.
